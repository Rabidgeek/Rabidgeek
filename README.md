### Howdy-doo! A little bit about me:
###
### - 🖥️ I'm very tech-savvy! While I'm highly skilled in the C family of languages (C, C++, C#), I also have a solid grasp on JavaScript. I am skilled with HTML/CSS/Wordpress—my current gig as assistant to the owner at <a href="https://www.eyethstudios.com">Eyeth Studios</a>, who has me juggling finances and website development. Python is my daily driver, seamlessly integrated into my work at Eyeth Studios, GoSign.Ai and beyond. Currently, I'm diving deep into iOS development and teaching myself React Native to broaden my app development prowess. I just launched my first iOS app on April 14th, 2024!

### - ⚡ Fun fact: I've nearly died a few times in my life - Spinal Meningitis (caused my deafness at 2.5 y/o), smoke inhalation from attic fire (5 y/o), hit by car (15 y/o), hit by train (17 y/o), and I still live for danger! OneWheels are the way to commute in a city! The latest adventure? My OneWheel glitched on September 22, 2023, launching me into a tough showdown with the pavement. I broke the tops of my tibia and fibula, as well as my patella. It’s been the most grueling recovery yet, but like a true warrior, the battle only makes me stronger.

### - 💪 For a visual, imagine a GIF of Iron Man crash-landing after a flight test gone awry—battered but unbeaten, ready to soar again.

### - 🥇 When I was an High School Science teacher, I was responsible for an after-school program at the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, called Deaf Kids Code, in which I taught a group of students how to develop a website for local businesses. They got to present their work at Comcast Headquearters in Philadelphia, PA, and I ended up greceiving an award for my work with these kids. I also hosted after school programs for Digital Image and Video Editing, Chess Clubs as well as being the Assistant Director for Track and Drama Club (for Drama, I made all the props and added some digital lightning and effects utilizing Arduino micro-controllers and the school's 3D printers).
