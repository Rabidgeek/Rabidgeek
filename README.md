### Howdy-doo! A little bit about me:
###
### - 🖥️ I'm very tech-savvy! I'm familiar with C, C++, C#, and JavaScript. I'm pretty good when it comes to HTML/CSS/Wordpress (my current job is assistant to the owner of Eyeth Studios, I do both finances and help with website development). I'm fairly good and getting much better with Python (taking classes at BloomTech for Data Science currently)
###
### - ⚡ Fun fact: I've nearly died a few times in my life - Spianl Meningitis (caused my deafness at 2.5 y/o), smoke inhalation from attic fire (5 y/0), hit by car (15 y/o), hit by train (17 y/o), and I still live for danger! OneWheels are the way to commute in a city! I have two dogs - Harley is a 9 year old Red-Nosed Pit Bull-Bullmastiff mix, and in July 2021 he was hit by a van on a back road, and had to have his left front limb amputated. Being a Tripawd isn't so terrible, he claims! Marley is a 1.5 year old Akita-Pit Bull mix, and she's currently pregnant (due Feb 9th) - the father is a Cane Corso-German Shepard mix, so we know her pups are gonna be hella gorgeous and formidable! I've built several PC's, a Hackintosh, and fixed countless friends' computers. 
###
### - 🥇 When I was an High School Science teacher, I was responsible for an after-school program at the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf, called Deaf Kids Code, in which I taught a group of students how to develop a website for local businesses. They got to present their work at Comcast Headquearters in Philadelphia, PA, and I ended up greceiving an award for my work with these kids. I also hosted after school programs for Digital Image and Video Editing, Chess Clubs as well as being the Assistant Director for Teack and Drama Club (for Drama, I made all the props and added some digital lightning and effects utilizing arduino microcontrollers and the school's 3D printers).
