### Howdy-doo! A little bit about me:
###
### - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on converting a school bus into a tiny house on wheels (skoolie) - it's one long project, follow me on Instagram at @RabidG33k
### - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science at BloomTech!
### - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an AI capable of recognizing ASL commands.
### - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I love to learn about everything and share what I've learned!
### - ðŸ“« How to reach me: email is best - g33k@jesseragsdale.com
### - âš¡ Fun fact: I've nearly died a few times in my life - Spianl Meningitis (caused my deafness at 2.5 y/o), smoke inhalation from attic fire (5 y/0), hit by car (15 y/o), hit by train (17 y/o), and I still live for danger! OneWheels are the way to commute in a city! I have two dogs - Harley is a 9 year old Red-Nosed Pit Bull-Bullmastiff mix, and in July 2021 he was hit by a van on a back road, and had to have his left front limb amputated. Being a Tripawd isn't so terrible, he claims! Marley is a 1.5 year old Akita-Pit Bull mix, and she's currently pregnant (due Feb 9th) - the father is a Cane Corso-German Shepard mix, so we know her pups are gonna be hella gorgeous and formidable!
